# NanoPi NEO / OrangePi PC

This is the base Nerves System configuration for the [NanoPi Neo](http://wiki.friendlyarm.com/wiki/index.php/NanoPi_NEO). It
also works on the [OrangePi PC](http://www.orangepi.org/orangepipc/), which is very nearly the same thing.

Both boards are based on the Allwinner H3 SoC, so any new boards using this SoC should be able to be ported without too much fuss.
